00:00:12.637 --> 00:00:16.970
I was six when I had the first chance to learn what patience means.

2
00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:21.281
My grandmother gave me a magic box as a birthday present,

3
00:00:21.305 --> 00:00:24.590
which neither of us knew would become a gift for life.

4
00:00:25.637 --> 00:00:28.114
I became obsessed with magic,

5
00:00:28.138 --> 00:00:31.709
and at 20, I became an amateur dove magician.

6
00:00:33.287 --> 00:00:36.414
This act of magic requires that I train my doves

7
00:00:36.438 --> 00:00:38.659
to sit and wait inside my clothing.

8
00:00:39.558 --> 00:00:44.281
As a young magician, I was always in a rush to make them appear,

9
00:00:44.305 --> 00:00:45.852
but my teacher told me

10
00:00:45.876 --> 00:00:49.264
the secret to the success of this magical act

11
00:00:49.288 --> 00:00:53.511
is to make my doves appear only after they've waited patiently

12
00:00:53.535 --> 00:00:54.768
in my tuxedo.

13
00:00:55.617 --> 00:00:58.637
It has to be a mindful kind of patience,

14
00:00:58.661 --> 00:01:01.649
the kind that took me some years to master.

15
00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:06.724
When life took me to Shanghai seven years ago,

16
00:01:06.748 --> 00:01:11.213
the mindful patience I learned became almost impossible to practice.

17
00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:16.208
In China, where everyone and everything is in a hurry,

18
00:01:16.232 --> 00:01:19.684
you need to outperform over 1.3 billion other people

19
00:01:19.708 --> 00:01:21.017
to build a better life.

20
00:01:22.421 --> 00:01:24.835
You hack the system, bend the rules,

21
00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:26.366
circumvent the boundaries.

22
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.381
It is the same when it comes to food ...

23
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.334
except that when it comes to food,

24
00:01:33.358 --> 00:01:36.413
impatience can have dire consequences.

25
00:01:37.438 --> 00:01:40.177
In the haste to grow more, sell more,

26
00:01:40.201 --> 00:01:45.184
4,000 years of agriculture in a country of rich natural resources

27
00:01:45.208 --> 00:01:48.588
is spoiled by the overuse of chemicals and pesticides.

28
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.423
In 2016, the Chinese government revealed

29
00:01:52.447 --> 00:01:56.739
half a million food safety violations in just nine months.

30
00:01:57.945 --> 00:02:01.676
Alarmingly, one in every four diabetics in the world

31
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.246
now comes from China.

32
00:02:04.562 --> 00:02:06.275
The stories around food

33
00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.761
are scary and somewhat overwhelming,

34
00:02:09.785 --> 00:02:15.181
and I told myself it's time to bring a mindful patience into the impatience.

35
00:02:16.172 --> 00:02:17.990
When I say mindful patience,

36
00:02:18.014 --> 00:02:20.021
I don't mean the ability to wait.

37
00:02:20.786 --> 00:02:23.619
I mean knowing how to act while waiting.

38
00:02:25.571 --> 00:02:28.156
And so, while I wait for the day

39
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.148
when a sustainable food system becomes a reality in China,

40
00:02:32.172 --> 00:02:35.482
I launched one of China's first online farmers market

41
00:02:35.506 --> 00:02:38.981
to bring local, organically grown produce to families.

42
00:02:40.308 --> 00:02:42.481
When we went live, 18 months ago,

43
00:02:42.505 --> 00:02:45.093
the food we could sell then was somewhat dismal.

44
00:02:45.826 --> 00:02:48.866
We had no fruit and hardly any meat to sell,

45
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.882
as none that was sent to the lab passed our zero tolerance test

46
00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:56.908
towards pesticides, chemicals, antibiotics and hormones.

47
00:02:57.392 --> 00:02:59.488
I told our very anxious employees

48
00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:03.964
that we would not give up until we've met every local farmer in China.

49
00:03:05.702 --> 00:03:09.544
Today, we supply 240 types of produce

50
00:03:09.568 --> 00:03:11.646
from 57 local farmers.

51
00:03:12.552 --> 00:03:15.126
After almost one year of searching,

52
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.997
we finally found chemical-free bananas

53
00:03:18.021 --> 00:03:21.211
grown in the backyards of villagers on Hainan Island.

54
00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:25.172
And only two hours away from Shanghai,

55
00:03:25.196 --> 00:03:29.267
on an island that even Google Maps does not have coordinates for,

56
00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:32.061
we found a place where cows eat grass

57
00:03:32.085 --> 00:03:34.251
and roam free under the blue sky.

58
00:03:35.761 --> 00:03:37.944
We also work hard on logistics.

59
00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.931
We deliver our customers' orders in as fast as three hours

60
00:03:41.955 --> 00:03:43.899
on electric vehicles,

61
00:03:43.923 --> 00:03:46.622
and we use biodegradable, reusable boxes

62
00:03:46.646 --> 00:03:49.200
to minimize our environmental footprint.

63
00:03:50.705 --> 00:03:54.737
I have no doubt that our offerings will continue to grow,

64
00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:56.674
but it will take time,

65
00:03:56.698 --> 00:04:01.293
and I know a lot more people are needed to shape the future of good food.

66
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:07.679
So last year, I founded China's first food tech accelerator and VC platform

67
00:04:07.703 --> 00:04:10.664
to help start-ups to shape the future of good food

68
00:04:10.688 --> 00:04:12.251
the way they want,

69
00:04:12.275 --> 00:04:17.220
be that through using edible insects as a more sustainable source of protein

70
00:04:17.244 --> 00:04:20.997
or using essential oils to keep food fresh for longer.

71
00:04:22.334 --> 00:04:24.414
So, you may still ask:

72
00:04:24.438 --> 00:04:27.755
Why are you trying to build a sustainable food system

73
00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:29.762
by driving a patient movement

74
00:04:29.786 --> 00:04:33.032
in a country where it's almost a crime to take it slow?

75
00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:35.506
Because, for me,

76
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.086
the real secret to success is patience --

77
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.919
a mindful kind of patience

78
00:04:40.943 --> 00:04:44.745
that requires knowing how to act while waiting,

79
00:04:44.769 --> 00:04:48.488
the kind of patience I learned with my grandmother's magic box.

80
00:04:49.685 --> 00:04:54.280
After all, we do not inherit the earth from our ancestors.

81
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.995
We borrow it from our children.

82
00:04:57.019 --> 00:04:58.170
Thank you.

83
00:04:58.194 --> 00:05:03.050
(Applause)
